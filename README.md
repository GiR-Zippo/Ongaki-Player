Ongaki - Player
===============

This should be an modular frontent for the omxplayer.
It represents a web-frontend with support for skins.

To get the status of the player you have to include the "/status.js".
This "file" contains arrays for our playlist and playerstatus, etc.

mpStatus[0] = Played File

mpStatus[1] = Status if playing

mpStatus[2] = actual volume

mpPlList = Playlist array

mpTrackInfo[0] = Tracktitle
